bootstrap-famous
================
The goal of bootstrap fomo.us is to create an easy to use bootstrap like website template using the Famo.us rendering engine. In doing so the template must take advantage of the speed improvements of famo.us while using the design style and components of bootstrap.

TODO:
[1] Add in CSS and Javascript connectivity. Make sure that styles are used as the default.
[2] Create menu effects using famo.us rendering capabilities.
[3] Have menu items pull in views of rendered pages instead of jumping to other pages.
[4] Add in other necessities of a site including metadata and favicon.
[5] Other ideas????
